# Car_Accidents
Car Accidents in the U.S. and their relationships with weather conditions, time of day, and population.

The power point file is a presentation of my findings. There is also a pdf version of the power point file that is available for viewing as well.

Main.py is the main file that I wrote most of my code in.
regression.r creates the regression table summary that is seen in the powerpoint presentation.
Three other files were used for maniputing data and creating new csv files that were used in Main.py and regression.r. One of which was written in Python. The others were written in R.

All other files are data visualizations or statistical findings exported out of Main.py or regression.r and saved as various file types. All of them are featured in the power point presentation.
